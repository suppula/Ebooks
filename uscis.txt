The status of this service request is:

On 11/03/2020, you or your representative contacted USCIS concerning your Form I-539 to notify us that you have not received your biometrics appointment notice. Below is a summary of what we found and how the issue has been or may be resolved.

Thank you for your inquiry regarding an appointment to have your biometric images processed at an Application Support Center (ASC). On March 18, 2020, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has suspended all biometrics appointments. As of the date of this letter, some ASC offices have re-opened in a limited capacity. However, not all ASC locations have re-opened fully.

Please visit our website for possible USCIS office closures: https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/uscis-office-closings.

As of March 30, 2020, USCIS may reuse previously submitted biometrics for certain form types including I-765 Application for Employment Authorization (EAD). This Management Directive is limited to the period during the COVID-19 pandemic and will automatically expire on Nov. 30, 2020, unless expressly extended by the USCIS deputy director for policy.

If you do not receive a notice of action regarding your case, please note that when USCIS again resumes normal operations, USCIS will automatically reschedule Application Support Center (ASC) appointments due to the office closures. If you do not receive a new appointment notice by mail within 90 days from the time when the ASC offices re-open, call 800-375-5283.

All ASC closures are posted on www.uscis.gov .  For up to date closure information, visit the USCIS Office Closures page.

Please also note that receipt of this letter does not guarantee that your case will be able to be adjudicated using previously captured biometrics and that processing of your case may in fact require an ASC appointment once the offices re-open.

We hope this information is helpful to you.
